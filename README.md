# rlsmart
The man in the middle, but only to add themes

## What?
realsmart is an online education service, built as an extension to Google's G Suite to help improve the VLE experience within UK schools.
However, rlsmart is very restrictive and locks down what is available to the end user.

The man in the middle endpoint allows us to inject extra themes into the rlsmart website to make using it more bearable.
